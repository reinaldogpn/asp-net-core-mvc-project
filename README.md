This is a basic web application using the Model‑View‑Controller (MVC) pattern with ASP.NET Core, applying fundamental concepts learned in a C# course. 

## The application includes:

* Typical MVC structure: implemented Controllers, Views (using Razor), and Models (POCOs), ensuring clear separation of concerns.
* CRUD workflow: created functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records via forms, including data validation using DataAnnotations and basic routing.
* Scaffolding & EF Core: utilized .NET CLI or Visual Studio tools for code scaffolding and integrated with a database (SQLite or SQL Server), following the “MvcMovie” tutorial pattern.
* Learning-focused project: served as a lab environment to reinforce MVC patterns, project structure, routing, and dynamic data rendering.

## Key skills demonstrated:

* Web development with ASP .NET Core MVC
* Building dynamic interfaces using Razor views
* Implementing presentation logic, data validation, and database interaction
* Familiarity with scaffolding tools, dependency injection, and C# project structure
